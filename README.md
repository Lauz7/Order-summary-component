## My process

Firstly, I ensured that my html code was solid, and arranged in my preferred format. 
I then began working on my external css file. When doing this I worked on the mobile site first â€“ ensuring that all elements responded correctly in their active states. 
I make sure to implement all basic css first so that the core of the site is strong before testing/adding in more complex properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
